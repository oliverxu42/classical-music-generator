# Classical Music Generator

Want to get into classical music but don't know where to start? Or maybe you're a seasoned classical music aficionado who's just about run out of things to listen to. Doesn't matter which category you fall into, this classical music generator will (soon) be able to satisfy all your musical needs!

## About

This project is mainly written in Typescript and React. Music data is supplied through the [Open Opus API](https://wiki.openopus.org/wiki/Using_the_Open_Opus_API). 

## Current Status

- Very early stages and not deployed yet
- Basic frontend, kinda messy atm as I'm still getting my head around React and Typescript
- Able to display a random selection of musical works

## Things for the Future

- [ ] Nicer looking frontend
- [ ] Have a way to filter pieces based on composer, genre, period etc.
- [ ] Link to recording of the work
- [ ] Deploy!
